# Shadow AI Discovery Audit Checklist

### 1. Technical Discovery
- [ ] **Network Logs:** Check for high traffic to non-sanctioned AI domains (e.g., `poe.com`, `perplexcity.ai`, `copy.ai`).
- [ ] **Browser Extensions:** Audit employee browsers for "AI Assistant" or "Sidebar" extensions.
- [ ] **Financial Review:** Check expense reports for "Pro" subscriptions to AI tools that aren't on the corporate account.

### 2. Human Intelligence (The "Safe" Survey)
- [ ] Send an anonymous survey: "Which AI tools help you work faster, even if we haven't approved them yet?"
- [ ] Interview department heads: "Are you using any AI for customer data analysis that isn't on our official list?"

### 3. Data Flow Audit
- [ ] Check if employees are using personal emails to log into AI platforms.
- [ ] Identify if sensitive code or client PII has been uploaded to public LLMs.
